# MatrxEngine
Engine I used in my old Java games and programs. 

This library uses Java's built-in Graphics2D library and
therefore the performance is on the lower end. Framerate drops 
drastically  when drawing something semi-transparent. 

This library also has built-in functions to play sounds at 
different volumes or looping.

This library provides a very primitive AABB colision system.
